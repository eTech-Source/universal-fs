# Contributing

We are glad you are here! We want to foster contributions that follow a high standard so please read this entire section.

# Tips for contributing

- ALWAYS make an issue before opening a PR
- If the issue already exists make a PR linked to the issue
- ALWAYS link to the specific issue your PR is solving
- PLEASE DO NOT OPEN A PUBLIC ISSUE ABOUT SECURITY FOR SECURITY ISSUES SEE [SECURITY](https://github.com/eTech-Source/tree/canary/SECURITY.md)

# The procedure for merges

1. We will make sure it passes all automated checks
2. We will make manual quality control checks
3. We will allow the community to give feedback and for EVERYONE'S feedback to be resolved (the maintainer(s), votes, and original PR opener(s) will decide what feedback will be considered). This will last for about a week unless the issue is urgent
4. The maintainer(s) will decide which version the PR will be included in. The PR will be merged into the version branch.
5. Once the version is released your contribution will be live ðŸŽ‰

# Checks and standards

## Version control

- Commit messages should follow the conventions shown out in [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification)
- Branch names should not have article adjectives in them. It is recommended to use the auto generated branch names made by GitHub

## Code quality

- Do not ignore Eslint or type errors this will be checked in CI
- Make sure your code is properly formatted (this should be done automatically in a pre-commit hook)

# Becoming a maintainer
