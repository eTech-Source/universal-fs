# `readFile`

## How does `readFile` work?

Asynchronously reads the entire contents of a file.

If no encoding is specified (using options.encoding), the data is returned as a Buffer object. Otherwise, the data will be a string.

If options is a string, then it specifies the encoding.

When the path is a directory, the behavior of `fsPromises.readFile()` is platform-specific. On macOS, Linux, and Windows, the promise will be rejected with an error. On FreeBSD, a representation of the directory's contents will be returned.

## Usage

An example of reading a `package.json` file located in the same directory of the running code:

```js
import {readFile} from "universal-fs";
try {
  const filePath = new URL("./package.json", import.meta.url);
  const contents = await readFile(filePath, {encoding: "utf8"});
  console.log(contents);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err.message);
}
```

It is possible to abort an ongoing readFile using an AbortSignal. If a request is aborted the promise returned is rejected with an AbortError:

```js
import {readFile} from "universal-fs";

try {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  const {signal} = controller;
  const promise = readFile(fileName, {signal});

  // Abort the request before the promise settles.
  controller.abort();

  await promise;
} catch (err) {
  // When a request is aborted - err is an AbortError
  console.error(err);
}
```

## Additional details

Aborting an ongoing request does not abort individual operating system requests but rather the internal buffering `fs.readFile` performs.

Any specified FileHandle has to support reading.

- **since** universal-fs v1.0.0 | Node.js v10.0.0
- **param** path filename or FileHandle
- **param** options Read options
- **return** Fulfills with the contents of the file.
