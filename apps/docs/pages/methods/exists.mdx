# `exists`

## Important!

Unlike most other methods exists is not backwards compatible with Node's depr ecated [exists](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsexistspath-callback) or [existsSync](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsexistspath-callback). Instead universal-fs has it's own more intuitive `exists` method. The primary differences are:

- It is not synchronous and must be called using `async`/`await`
- It does not support a callback API
- You can abort the operation by passing an `AbortSignal`

For the full reasoning behind this please see [Why is `exists` not backwards compatible with Node fs?](https://github.com/eTech-Source/universal-fs/issues/26)

## How does `exists` work?

A modern implementation of the Node fs [exists](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsexistspath-callback) API.
Returns `true` if the path exists, `false` otherwise in promise form.

## Usage

```ts
import {exists} from "universal-fs";

const hasFoundFile = await exists("/path/to/file.txt");
```

You can also abort an outgoing request using an `AbortSignal`. If a request is aborted the promise returned is rejected with an AbortError:

```ts
import {exists} from "universal-fs";

const controller = new AbortController();
const {signal} = controller;

const hasFoundFile = await exists("/path/to/file.txt", {signal});

controller.abort();
```

## Additional details

- **since** universal-fs v1.3.0
- **return** A promise that resolves to `true` if found otherwise `false`
