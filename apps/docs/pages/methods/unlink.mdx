# `unlink`

## How does `unlink` work?

If `path` refers to a symbolic link, then the link is removed without affecting
the file or directory to which that link refers. If the `path` refers to a file
path that is not a symbolic link, the file is deleted. See the POSIX [`unlink(2)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unlink.2.html) documentation for more detail.

_Note: In universal-fs you can abort a request using `AbortController`_

## Additional details

- **since** universal-fs V1.0.0 | Node.js v10.0.0
- **param** path A path to a file. If a URL is provided, it must use the `file:` protocol.
- **param** options An Abortable
- **return** Fulfills with ~~`undefined`~~ `void` upon success.
