# What is a method

A method is any node fs operation available in universal-fs. For example `readFile` is a method. Here are a list of all available methods:

All of these are fully backwards compatible with the Node fs promise api:

- `mkdir`
- `readdir`
- `readFile`
- `rmdir`
- `unlink`
- `writeFile`

And these are not:

- `exists`
